## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each named according to the format:

```
<problem-number>-<problem-name>
```

For instance:
- `1-two-sum` refers to the "Two Sum" problem with ID 1.

Each folder contains:
- A C++ file with the problem's solution.
- Execution details (runtime and memory usage).
